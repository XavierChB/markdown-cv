## Interests

Compilers and optimizing compilers, hardware architecture and heterogeneous architecture computing. 

## Education

`2021-2025`
__Computer Science Tripos, Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge__

- Current 3rd year student.

## Skills
Intermediate to good proficiency in C, C++ (in particular modern C++), Python and OCaml.

Daily driving Linux for more than 3 years, comfortable with various shell environments.

Happy VIMer, currently daily driving a heavily customized (Neo)vim setup.

Limited skills in HDL (proficient in subset of SystemVerilog taught in part IB course in Cambridge).

## Experiences & Achievements

### Internship
`June - Sept 2021`
___Intern_ at Honeywell Aerospace, Shanghai__

Interned at the mechanical design and engineering department.

Automated the department’s administrative processes with Python. Created 30-40 hours
of productivity savings per quarter.
Conducted thermal characterization experiments for various critical materials used in
aircraft in development.

Developed standardized reparation procedures for aviation brake assemblies for client
aircraft reparation company, currently servicing over 100 cargo jets per year.

### Projects
`Oct 2023 - May 2024`
___Undergraduate Dissertation Project: Invisible CHERI Capability___

Project Mentor: Dr. Jonathan Woodruff

Project scope: Designed and implemented new semantics to CHERI-RISC-V ISA to compress existing
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> capabilities to half its size, while retaining CHERI's safety guarantees.

Researched and adapted "compressed" permissions format in CHERI capabilities, evaluated
the effects of these changes using static and runtime profiles.

Proposed novel solution to address semantical and syntactic changes required to compress the "object
type" section of the CHERI capability while retaining the existing sealing syntax.

Emulated hardware adaptation to the semantical changes proposed above by modifying the QEMU emulator,
implemented new instructions for "sealing" in LLVM.

Top 10% dissertation in the cohort.

`July - Sept 2023`
___UROP Project: TVM TensorCode Generation Benchmarks___

Project Mentor: Dr. Eiko Yoneki

Project scope: Worked on a set of benchmarks for TVM's evolutionary-search-based automatic scheduler,
explored replacing the evolutionary search with Bayesian optimisation.

`June - Sept 2022`
___UROP Project: Optimizing Compilers-Automatic Parallelization_, University of Cambridge__

Project Mentor: Prof. Timothy M. Jones

Project scope: Worked under the <a href="https://github.com/CompArchCam/Janus/">JANUS</a> project,
a "same-ISA dynamic binary modification tool controlled through static analysis". 

Utilized the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints">"constraints"</a> features
introduced in C++20 to modularize existing, monolithic static analysis pipeline, while providing an
elegant approach to express the dependency relations between analysis stages, and allow for easy future
extensions. 

Rewrote some of the pipelines to utilize the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory">"smart pointers"</a>
introduced in C++11 to provide better memory-management to existing work, and eliminated many instances of
memory leaks through this approach. 

Implemented dataflow and liveness analysis using the refactored architecture, to provide an example of static analysis
extensions under the refactored structure. 

GitHub link to the branch I worked in: <a href="https://github.com/CompArchCam/Janus/tree/refactor_redo">Janus refactor</a>

`Jan - June 2021`
___Source Academy Project_, National University of Singapore__
Project scope: ECMAScript subset implementation on various platforms for introductory
functional programming course.

Learnt compilers and virtual machine principles, help implemented the virtual machine for
the said language subset in C and C++ on ESP32 embedded system based on
WebAssembly. <a href="https://github.com/XavierChB/sinter/tree/master/vm">VM code</a>.

Developed drivers for various sensors and actuators in C to interface between the Source
Language API and the ESP32 controller. Enables future development of robotics platform
based on the system. <a href="https://github.com/XavierChB/sinter/tree/master/devices/esp32">Driver code</a>.

### Awards and Achievements
`2020`
___Google Code Jam_, top 15% globally in round 1C__

`2018`
___Singapore Young Physicist’ Tournament_, Team gold medal(2nd place)__
Proposed mathematical models for complex physics phenomenon bases on literature
review.
Verified models using numerical simulation with MATLAB along with experiments.
Presented to an audience of more than 200 people and defended the validity of our study
in the debate (physics fight) phase in the final competition.

`2017`
___Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad__, Gold Medal_

Obtained the highest prize in the competition.

`2017`
___Citi-YMCA Youth for Causes_, Member of Executive Committee__

Organized various activities (beach cleaning, street campaigns, etc.) to raise public
awareness on issues with local marine ecology and marine environmental protection in
coastal areas.
